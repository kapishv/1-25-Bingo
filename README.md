# 1-25 Bingo
The usual 1-25 bingo game played between two bored students in a classroom.

A few points regarding the game are as follows:
1) This game is played between two players in alternate turns.
2) Each one gets a bingo card which is a 5x5 grid filled randomly with numbers from 1 to 25 (without repeatation).
3) A player in his/her turn is required to call an unmarked number from his/her card.
4) The number called has to be marked by both players on their cards.
5) Whenever all the numbers in a line (row, column or diagonal) of 5 elements are marked, an unmarked letter in the string "BINGO" is marked.(If you did't understand this point, then you could run the code on a browser and  mark the elements in a line of 5)
6) The first player with all 5 letters of the string "BINGO" marked wins the game. (If both players accomplish this task at the same time, then it is a draw)
